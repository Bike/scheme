It's your run of the mill half-assed Scheme. Nothing to see here. Wrote this to start learning Rust.

Supported:

* Integers, but with no valid operations
* `if` and `eq?`
* abstraction (i.e. `lambda`)

And that's it.

No garbage collector; just uses `Rc`. Figuring out how to do that is the next major hurdle but I probably won't do it in this repo.
